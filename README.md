### The Dog Park is a blogging and networking app, made just for dog owners! Users can post stories about their dogs and any cool tips and tricks they've learned, display info about the dogs they own, and connect with other users by adding them as friends! 

#### Adding Friends:
There are currently two ways that you can add friends:
##### Friend Code:
Every user is supplied a unique identifier friend code, which can be found in the Profile Menu, in the Friend Code tab. This is also the location to add other users by friend code. If you meet someone you'd like to add as a friend, just shoot them a text or have them write down the code to enter into the input field, and after clicking "Add Friend", you'll immediately be added to each other's friend contacts.

##### Send Friend Request:
Sometimes you'll find a user online that has a blog you really like, has dogs you'd like to meet, or are just interested in getting to know. In this case, just go to their profile and click on the "Add Friend" button. For security reasons, they will have to accept your friend request. After sending the request, a message will appear on their profile, notifying you that the request is pending. If they've accepted your request to be friends, this display will change to display their new status as a friend.

##### Checking Friend Requests:
To check if you've recieved any friend requests, log in and navigate to the Profile Menu. From here, click on the tab labelled "Friend Requests". This will render the page containing all users that have sent you a friend request. To view their profile, click on their name and you will be redirected to their profile page. To accept their request, simply click on the "Accept Request" button, and you will be added to each other's friend contacts.
